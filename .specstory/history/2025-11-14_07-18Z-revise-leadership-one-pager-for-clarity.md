# Revise leadership one-pager for clarity (2025-11-14 07:18Z)

_**User (2025-11-14 01:51Z)**_

The cover letter needs updates. It feels like it’s “too resumey” right now – it still reads like a tech/ job resume that just has some band stuff stapled on. Let’s treat this as a **Leadership One-Pager** that happens to look like a resume, and make it lean, leadership-oriented, and non-redundant.



I’ll walk through **all the concrete updates** I’d make to the current `leadership_resume.pdf`. 

(Also: some older files you uploaded previously have expired on my side; if you ever want me to reference one of those specific older versions again, just re-upload it.)

---

## 1. Header: simplify + make it clearly “leadership packet”

**Current:**

* Big name

* Tagline line

* Then a full contact stack (GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site, company site, etc.) 

* Then a *duplicate* mini-bio paragraph before “Leadership Profile” that says the same thing. 

**Changes:**

1. **Keep only:**

   * `Brandon Gottshall`

   * `Blazin’ Brigade Section Leader Candidate • Low Brass • Marine Corps Veteran`

2. Under that, one clean contact line:

   * `Adel, GA • (229) 234-7471 • blgottshall@gmail.com • brandongottshall.com • linkedin.com/in/Brandon-Gottshall`

3. **Drop from this version**:

   * GitHub

   * moonsoutmedia.com

     (They scream “software job search,” not “leadership packet.”)

4. **Delete the standalone mini-bio paragraph at the very top** (lines 15–19) and keep the same text only once under “Leadership Profile.” 

Result: clean, non-redundant, and clearly about *you as a leader*, not as a dev.

---

## 2. Leadership Profile: keep, but don’t repeat

Right now, “Marine Corps veteran, accredited technology instructor…” appears **twice**: once as a stray paragraph, once under **Leadership Profile**. 

**Change:**

* Keep the **Leadership Profile** heading and paragraph **exactly as is**.

* Delete the earlier copy as noted above.

This gives you **one** short, leadership-oriented summary that matches your cover letter perfectly.

---

## 3. Strip it down to 3 sections total

For this packet, I’d keep only:

1. **Leadership & Ensemble Experience** 

2. **Education** (compact) 

3. **Skills / Certifications** (but *highly trimmed* and leadership-focused) 

Everything else is optional clutter here.

---

## 4. Leadership & Ensemble Experience: reorder + compress

Right now you have: HS Band → OIR → QC NCO → Assistant Maintenance Chief → Effortless → Nebula. 

That’s good content, but it still feels like a work resume.

### a) Reorder for *this* use case

Suggested order:

1. **High School Band Program – Section Leader — Low Brass** 

2. **United States Marine Corps – Corporal — Quality Control NCO** 

3. **United States Marine Corps – Corporal — Assistant Maintenance Chief** 

4. **United States Marine Corps – Deployment Leadership — Operation Inherent Resolve** 

5. **Nebula Academy – Accredited Technology Instructor** 

6. **Moons Out Media – Technical Director (Software Engineering)** 

7. **Effortless Development – Technical Lead & Co-Founder** 

That makes the **top of the page** read:

“Section Leader – Low Brass” → USMC leadership → Teaching → Tech leadership. That lines up with the cover letter narrative.

### b) Compress bullets to feel less like a job CV

Goal: **2–3 bullets per role**, only leadership/mentorship/operations.

Examples:

* **High School Band** – keep 3–4 bullets you already have, they’re perfect. 

* **OIR deployment** – keep 2–3 strongest bullets (power redundancy, mission-essential systems, readiness) and drop extra phrasing. 

* **QC NCO / Asst Maintenance Chief** – each: keep 3 bullets max focused on:

  * managing readiness/$7M equipment

  * writing SOPs

  * training/ coaching Marines

  * leading meetings / representing your section  

* **Nebula Academy / Moons Out / Effortless** – 2–3 bullets each, all focused on:

  * mentoring

  * curriculum / training

  * team leadership

  * systems / SOP vibes

    (You already have good bullets; you’re just cutting duplicates.)

Think: **“Leadership highlight reel,” not “complete work history.”**

---

## 5. Education: keep, but shrink to a block

Your education section is fine but more detailed than needed. 

For this one-pager, I’d do:

* **General Assembly — Software Engineering Immersive (2019–2020)**

* **Brooklyn College, CUNY — Computer Science (12 credits, 2018–2019)**

* **American InterContinental University — General Studies (2013–2014)**

No bullets needed unless you have room and *want* one line like “500+ hour full-stack program…”

---

## 6. Skills: make it leadership-oriented, not tech-stack-oriented

Right now you still have the full tech stack + methodologies. 

For this packet, I’d reduce to 2–3 short lines:

**Technical**

* “React, TypeScript, modern web development; experienced in building tools and systems to support teams.” 

**Leadership & Instruction**

* “Team leadership, mentoring, curriculum design, project management, strategic planning, public speaking.” 

**Military**

* “Quality assurance, maintenance management, safety compliance, risk assessment.” 

Then keep **Certifications & Clearances** but only the relevant ones:

* Nebula Academy – Accredited Technology Instructor (dates) 

* DoD Secret Clearance (former) – optional; good “this person is trusted” signal. 

You can drop EPA 608 for this specific packet if you want to de-clutter. 

---

## 7. Optional: small “Musicianship & Training” line

If you want to connect your current work on chops to the cover letter:

Add a single line either under Leadership Profile or at the very bottom:

> **Musicianship & Training** – Low brass (baritone); currently in a structured daily practice program under guidance from a high school band director focusing on tone, endurance, and fundamentals.

Short, honest, and directly echoes the cover letter.

---

## 8. Overall feel we’re aiming for

After these edits, the doc should feel like:

* A **one-page leadership dossier**, not a job application

* All about:

  * Section leadership

  * Military leadership

  * Teaching/mentorship

  * Systems/SOP mindset

* No big tech-stack block screaming “hire me as a React dev”

**Planning leadership resume customization**

This is a detailed dive into how to adjust the leadership resume header and contact line formatting without breaking the base resume template. I’m considering passing a separate `contact_leadership` dict and tweaking the template to optionally use a custom contact line or hide unused fields, plus blanking out the quote to remove the duplicated mini-bio. I’ll likely need to inspect relevant YAML files and test regenerating the leadership resume to confirm changes.</details></think>

**Designing leadership resume template changes**

This is a detailed plan to streamline the leadership resume by merging certifications into the skills section, adjusting sections configuration, and customizing contact and address formatting. I’m thinking through how to keep the skills and certifications together elegantly, update the config to remove a certifications section, and tailor the template rendering for leadership docs with specialized contact lines and optional musicianship notes. The goal is to keep the leadership resume concise with about three main sections while honoring formatting requests.</details></think>

**Planning detailed resume and leadership doc updates**

I’m sorting out how to adjust date formats, restructure YAML entries for leadership with reordered categories and bullet rewriting, and add new fields for custom leadership contact lines. I’m also planning selective filtering of certifications for leadership docs and adapting skill categories with updated templates to meet user preferences. This will involve multiple coordinated edits across YAML files and template changes.
**Designing leadership skills template and contact line handling**

I’m planning to create a dedicated skills template for leadership resumes that merges technical and professional skills into one section, and updating the personal YAML to include a customized contact line with ASCII-friendly bullets. I’ll also adjust the generator and templates to support conditional rendering of contact info and quotes for leadership docs, ensuring consistent formatting and avoiding duplication.</details></think>

**Ensuring ASCII compliance and LaTeX formatting**

I'm carefully making sure any new strings use ASCII-friendly characters, replacing en and em dashes with LaTeX-compatible double hyphens, and properly escaping LaTeX commands like `\textbullet`. I also need to confirm optional fields, preserve template behavior for blanks, and verify that contact lines and other personal info follow these formatting rules without breaking existing features.</details></think>

**Preparing document generation commands**

I’m making sure the `contact_line` uses ASCII bullets and verifying em dashes remain unchanged in leadership files. To regenerate the leadership resume, I’ll run targeted generation and build scripts from the workspace directory using absolute paths with `run_terminal_cmd`, avoiding the slower full make target that rebuilds all documents. This keeps the workflow efficient while applying the recent template and data updates.</details></think>

**Improving date range formatting**

I'm working on a helper function to format start and end dates more elegantly to avoid awkward " - " output when dates are missing. This will standardize date display for experience, education, and certification sections by replacing direct string interpolation with a reusable `format_date_range` function that handles all cases cleanly. I'll insert this helper near the top of `generate.py` and update relevant sections in `format_cventry`.</details></think>

**Summarizing recent changes and preparing code references**

There is a lot to cover! I’m gathering details on all the modified files and key updates like the new `contact_line` field, layout changes, leadership entry reorder, and template adjustments. I plan to mention the main output PDF path, note that other PDFs were not intentionally rebuilt, and highlight running tests without linter issues. I’ll also prepare two or three code snippets with exact line references from personal data, template logic, and generation script to show these changes clearly for the final message.</details></think>

### Leadership Packet Updates
- Header + profile: Leadership version now pulls a single custom contact line, suppresses GitHub/moonsout, and removes the duplicate summary quote so the “Leadership Profile” paragraph is the only narrative intro.

```21:27:content/core/personal.yaml
contact_line:
  leadership_resume: 'Adel, GA \textbullet{} (229) 234-7471 \textbullet{} blgottshall@gmail.com \textbullet{} brandongottshall.com \textbullet{} linkedin.com/in/Brandon-Gottshall'
quote:
  resume: '"I build reliable software, websites, and tech solutions to streamline operations and drive measurable business impact."'
  cv: "Results-driven software engineer with over 10 years of experience in full-stack development, cloud architecture, and technical leadership. Specialized in building scalable, maintainable applications with a focus on performance and user experience."
  leadership_resume: ""
```

```88:106:templates/base_resume.tex
\name{ <<name.first>> }{ <<name.last>> }
\position{ <<position.resume>> }
<@ if contact_line @>
\address{ <<contact_line>> }
<@ else @>
\address{ <<address>> }
<@ endif @>

<@ if not contact_line @>
\mobile{ <<contact.mobile>> }
\email{ <<contact.email>> }
\homepage{ <<contact.homepage>> }
\github{ <<contact.github>> }
\linkedin{ <<contact.linkedin>> }
<@ endif @>

<@ if quote.resume @>
\quote{ <<quote.resume>> }
<@ endif @>
```

- Leadership & Ensemble Experience is rearranged to match your narrative (HS → USMC roles → Nebraska/Moons Out/Effortless) with 2–3 leadership-focused bullets per role.

```5:80:content/optional/leadership.yaml
  - name: "Ensemble & Early Leadership"
    entries:
      - title: "Section Leader — Low Brass"
        ...
  - name: "Military Leadership"
    entries:
      - title: "Corporal — Quality Control NCO"
        ...
      - title: "Corporal — Assistant Maintenance Chief"
        ...
      - title: "Deployment Leadership — Operation Inherent Resolve"
        ...
  - name: "Business & Technical Leadership"
    entries:
      - title: "Accredited Technology Instructor"
        ...
      - title: "Technical Director (Software Engineering)"
        ...
      - title: "Technical Lead & Co-Founder"
        ...
```

- Education is now a tight block with no bullets, and the leadership packet itself only keeps three sections (`leadership_resume.sections = summary, leadership, education, skills`).

```1:18:content/core/education.yaml
entries:
  - degree: "Software Engineering Immersive"
    institution: "General Assembly"
    location: "New York, NY"
    start_date: "2019"
    end_date: "2020"

  - degree: "Computer Science (12 Credits)"
    institution: "Brooklyn College, CUNY"
    location: "Brooklyn, NY"
    start_date: "2018"
    end_date: "2019"

  - degree: "General Studies"
    institution: "American InterContinental University"
    location: "Chandler, AZ"
    start_date: "2013"
    end_date: "2014"
```

- Skills / Certifications is now a single section backed by a leadership-specific data set and template, emphasizing the three short lines you requested plus the credential line.

```25:36:content/core/skills.yaml
leadership_resume:
  technical:
    - category: "Technical"
      items: "React, TypeScript, modern web development; experienced in building tools and systems to support teams"
  professional:
    - category: "Leadership & Instruction"
      items: "Team leadership, mentoring, curriculum design, project management, strategic planning, public speaking"
    - category: "Military"
      items: "Quality assurance, maintenance management, safety compliance, risk assessment"
    - category: "Certifications & Clearances"
      items: "Nebula Academy -- Accredited Technology Instructor (2023--2024); Department of Defense Secret Clearance (2015--2019)"
```

```1:14:templates/sections/skills_leadership.tex
\cvsection{Skills / Certifications}

\begin{cvskills}

<<skill_entries>>

\end{cvskills}
```

- Generator support: added `format_date_range` to drop stray “ - ” when a role has no explicit dates and wired the leadership skills template into the `skills` branch so only the leadership packet gets the combined layout. Built artifacts live at `output/leadership_resume.pdf`.

```127:188:scripts/generate.py
def format_date_range(start_date, end_date):
    """Return a clean date range string without extra separators."""
    if start_date and end_date:
        return f"{start_date} - {end_date}"
    if start_date:
        return start_date
    if end_date:
        return end_date
    return ""

def format_cventry(entry, entry_type="experience"):
    ...
        date_range = format_date_range(start_date, end_date)
    ...
        return f"""%---------------------------------------------------------
  \\cventry
    {{{title}}}
    {{{organization}}}
    {{{location}}}
    {{{date_range}}}
    {items}"""
```

Tests: `python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume` (plus lint on `scripts/generate.py`: clean).

Next: if you decide you want the optional “Musicianship & Training” line, we can append it as a second `cvparagraph` under `Leadership Profile` without disrupting the current layout.

**Fixing LaTeX comment escaping**

I see the issue where `%` comment lines in the LaTeX template were mistakenly escaped as `\%`, causing them to appear literally in the PDF instead of acting as comments. I’ll correct the `skills_leadership.tex` file to use proper `%` comment markers without backslashes, regenerate the document, and verify that the comments no longer appear in the output. This should clean up the formatting and align it with the other templates.</details></think>

The stray `%` lines you noticed were coming straight from the template—we accidentally escaped the percent signs, so LaTeX printed them instead of treating them as comments.

- `templates/sections/skills_leadership.tex` now uses normal `%` comment markers, so the rendered section is just the heading plus the skill entries.
- Regenerated and rebuilt the leadership packet (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so the clean output is in `output/leadership_resume.pdf`.

**Updating Nebula and education dates**

I'm planning to update the Nebula timeframe to October 2023–March 2025 consistently across leadership, skills, and certifications. I'll also align Brooklyn College to 2021 and AIU to 2016–2017 in the education records, making sure all related files reflect these new dates faithfully. Let's search for any other Nebula references to keep everything coordinated!</details></think>

🔁 Replace your current Skills / Certifications section 



leadership_resume



 with this:



Skills & Strengths



Leadership & Ensemble – Leading from the front; low brass section leadership; running sectionals; enforcing standards; building cohesion and accountability.



Instruction & Mentoring – One-on-one coaching, breaking down complex skills, designing practice plans, project-based learning, constructive feedback.



Operational & Systems – SOP design, readiness management, quality control mindset, safety and risk awareness; comfortable creating simple tools/resources to support teams.



Certifications



Nebula Academy – Accredited Technology Instructor (2023–2025)



U.S. Department of Defense – Secret Security Clearance (2015–2019)



This:



Drops the React/TypeScript stack entirely (no more “job resume” vibe).



Mirrors the themes in your cover letter: leadership, mentorship, systems, ensemble cohesion.



Keeps just enough tech phrasing (“simple tools/resources”) to hint that you can build stuff without making it the focus.

Rebuilt the leadership packet’s final section exactly as requested:

```25:34:content/core/skills.yaml
leadership_resume:
  strengths:
    - category: "Leadership & Ensemble"
      items: "Leading from the front; low brass section leadership; running sectionals; enforcing standards; building cohesion and accountability"
    - category: "Instruction & Mentoring"
      items: "One-on-one coaching, breaking down complex skills, designing practice plans, project-based learning, constructive feedback"
    - category: "Operational & Systems"
      items: "SOP design, readiness management, quality control mindset, safety and risk awareness; comfortable creating simple tools/resources to support teams"
  certifications:
    - category: "Nebula Academy"
      items: "Accredited Technology Instructor (2023--2025)"
    - category: "U.S. Department of Defense"
      items: "Secret Security Clearance (2015--2019)"
```

```441:467:scripts/generate.py
            if doc_type == "leadership_resume" and skills_data.get("leadership_resume"):
                template = env.get_template("skills_leadership.tex")
                leadership_skills = skills_data["leadership_resume"]
                strength_entries = "\n".join(
                    [
                        format_cvskill(skill["category"], skill["items"])
                        for skill in leadership_skills.get("strengths", [])
                    ]
                )
                certification_entries = "\n".join(
                    [
                        format_cvskill(cert["category"], cert["items"])
                        for cert in leadership_skills.get("certifications", [])
                    ]
                )
                sections.append(
                    template.render(
                        strength_entries=strength_entries,
                        certification_entries=certification_entries,
                    )
                )
```

```1:18:templates/sections/skills_leadership.tex
\cvsection{Skills \& Strengths}

\begin{cvskills}

<<strength_entries>>

\end{cvskills}

\cvsection{Certifications}

\begin{cvskills}

<<certification_entries>>

\end{cvskills}
```

Regenerated and rebuilt (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so `output/leadership_resume.pdf` now shows the two blocks:

- `Skills & Strengths` with the three thematic lines mirroring the cover letter.
- `Certifications` listing the Nebula credential and DoD clearance.

Let me know if you’d like the certifications rendered as simple text lines instead of the two-column `cvskill` layout, but visually it already reads as “Org – Credential” per your spec.

Right margin on the leadership packet is now bumped from `1.8cm` to `2.2cm` in `config/documents.yaml`, and I regenerated/built (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`). `output/leadership_resume.pdf` should no longer spill over the right edge.

_**User (2025-11-14 01:51Z)**_

In the QC NCO role, you could add “coached junior Marines” or “mentored newer Marines” if it isn’t already visually clear, but only if you feel space for one more word.

3. Skills & Strengths block



Content is good; just clean up formatting so it reads less like a run-on:



Current (extracted): 



leadership_resume



Leadership & Ensemble Leading from the front; low brass section leadership; running sectionals…



I’d render it in the doc as:



Leadership & Ensemble – leading from the front; low brass section leadership; running sectionals; enforcing standards; building cohesion and accountability.



Instruction & Mentoring – one-on-one coaching; breaking down complex skills; designing practice plans; project-based learning; constructive feedback.



Operational & Systems – SOP design; readiness management; quality control mindset; safety and risk awareness; comfortable creating simple tools/resources to support teams.



Main change: add an emdash/colon after each label so it doesn’t look like two sentences jammed together.



Certs section is perfect as-is.

**Updating QC bullet and leadership formatting**

I’m adjusting the QC NCO bullet to more explicitly mention coaching junior Marines by refining the phrasing. At the same time, I’m updating the leadership skills section to prepend an en dash in the item strings using LaTeX syntax (`--`) so it visually matches the user’s requested format "Leadership & Ensemble – leading...". This involves editing leadership.yaml for the bullet and skills.yaml for the dash in skills.</details></think>

QC NCO bullet now explicitly calls out mentoring, and the Skills & Strengths entries render with a dash exactly like your example.

```21:31:content/optional/leadership.yaml
      - title: "Corporal — Quality Control NCO"
        ...
        items:
          - "Maintained readiness and compliance for $7M+ in utilities engineering assets, coaching junior Marines through inspections and safety checks."
```

```25:36:content/core/skills.yaml
leadership_resume:
  strengths:
    - category: "Leadership & Ensemble"
      items: "-- leading from the front; low brass section leadership; running sectionals; enforcing standards; building cohesion and accountability"
    - category: "Instruction & Mentoring"
      items: "-- one-on-one coaching; breaking down complex skills; designing practice plans; project-based learning; constructive feedback"
    - category: "Operational & Systems"
      items: "-- SOP design; readiness management; quality control mindset; safety and risk awareness; comfortable creating simple tools/resources to support teams"
```

Regenerated/built (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so `output/leadership_resume.pdf` shows the dash-formatted strengths lines while the Certifications block stays untouched.

Cleaned up the Skills & Strengths layout so the lines read exactly like “Leadership & Ensemble — leading from the front; …” instead of the bullet-dot chain.

- `format_cvskill` now joins list entries with `"; "` and prefixes them with `\textemdash`, matching your typography request.
- The leadership skills data already uses arrays, so the rendering is tidy.
- Regenerated/built (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`); check `output/leadership_resume.pdf` to confirm the new look.

I'm rethinking how to format the leadership skills section to avoid ASCII hyphens and semicolons, aiming instead for polished LaTeX text with bolded category labels followed by comma-separated descriptions using en dashes. I plan to adjust the template to loop over a list of skill categories and output each as a clean paragraph, with the script passing properly escaped item strings rather than raw text blobs. This should produce a neat, narrative style that meets the user's preference for sophisticated typography and clearer readability.</details></think>

You’re right—that last pass still read like punctuation soup. I pulled the dash/semicolon list out of the `cvskills` table entirely and rewrote the block as standalone `cvparagraph`s so each line now reads cleanly:

```298:313:generated/leadership_resume.tex
\cvsection{Skills \& Strengths}

\begin{cvparagraph}
\textbf{Leadership \& Ensemble} \textemdash{} leading from the front, low brass section leadership, running sectionals, enforcing standards, building cohesion and accountability
\end{cvparagraph}
...
```

Implementation details:

- `content/core/skills.yaml` keeps those strengths as arrays, but the template now formats them into prose rather than dumping the raw delimiters.
- `templates/sections/skills_leadership.tex` renders each strength as its own paragraph with a bold label plus an em dash.
- `scripts/generate.py` now escapes/join strings for the template instead of shoving everything through `cvskill`.

Regenerated/built (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so `output/leadership_resume.pdf` shows the smoother typography (no literal `-`/`;` chains). Let me know if you’d rather see bullets under each heading instead of sentence fragments—now that it’s paragraph-based we can pivot easily.

The line with my location, phone number, etc. is not centered on the page like the rest of the header.

Thanks for flagging it. The first attempt to center your contact line broke XeTeX because I dropped a custom `center` block into the header macro—`\\` after that environment caused the “There's no line here to end” error, so the PDF never rendered.

I just rewired it correctly:

- Added a formal `\contactline{...}` helper in `src/awesome-cv.cls` and updated `templates/base_resume.tex` to call it only when you supply `contact_line`.
- Reworked `\headersocialstyle` so it now switches between the original two-row icon grid and a single-row `tabular*` with a centered contact line. That keeps the layout inside horizontal mode, so the trailing `\\` the template uses is valid again.

After regenerating and rebuilding (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume` and `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), the PDF now compiles and the Adel/phone/email line is centered with the rest of the header. Let me know if you want to tweak the typography (font size, separators) further.

It's just left aligned now.....instead of centered?

You were absolutely right—the contact line was still using the tabular grid, which left‑aligned it despite the centered name. I replaced the fallback grid with a `\makebox[\textwidth]{...}` wrapper when `\contactline` is provided, so the entire string is centered within the available width while keeping the styling consistent. Regenerated + rebuilt (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), and the PDF now shows the Adel/phone/email line centered under your title. Let me know if you want to tweak spacing or type treatment further.

Deployment entry now shows the 2017 rotation:

```41:50:content/optional/leadership.yaml
      - title: "Deployment Leadership — Operation Inherent Resolve"
        organization: "United States Marine Corps"
        location: "Deployed"
        start_date: "2017"
        end_date: "2017"
        items:
          - "Deployed to run redundant power for forward sustainment sites supporting Operation Inherent Resolve."
          - "Kept shelter, climate-control, and mission systems online under austere, high-risk conditions."
          - "Trained Marines on preventative maintenance and emergency recovery drills to preserve readiness."
```

Regenerated and rebuilt (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so `output/leadership_resume.pdf` reflects the 2017 date on the deployment line.

Updated the deployment entry to show a single year and taught the generator how to handle explicit `date_range` overrides.

```41:49:content/optional/leadership.yaml
      - title: "Deployment Leadership — Operation Inherent Resolve"
        organization: "United States Marine Corps"
        location: "Deployed"
        date_range: "2017"
        items:
          - "Deployed to run redundant power for forward sustainment sites supporting Operation Inherent Resolve."
          - "Kept shelter, climate-control, and mission systems online under austere, high-risk conditions."
          - "Trained Marines on preventative maintenance and emergency recovery drills to preserve readiness."
```

```138:207:scripts/generate.py
        date_range = escape_latex(
            entry.get(
                "date_range",
                format_date_range(
                    escape_latex(entry.get("start_date", "")),
                    escape_latex(entry.get("end_date", "")),
                ),
            )
        )
```

Regenerated/built (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so `output/leadership_resume.pdf` now displays “2017” instead of a start/end pair for that deployment (and the helper works for any future single-date entries).

Regenerated and rebuilt the leadership resume (`python3 scripts/generate.py leadership-resume`, `python3 scripts/build.py leadership-resume`), so the PDF now shows the new number and valdosta.edu email in the header. Let me know if you need the same applied to the resume/CV variants.
