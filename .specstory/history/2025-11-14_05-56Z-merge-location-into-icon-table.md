# Merge location into icon table (2025-11-14 05:56Z)

_**User (2025-11-14 01:51Z)**_

Can you merge the location into the icon table? It looks out of place by itself. 



Can you also split the icon table into three columns so it doesn't take up 3 inches of paper?

**Planning document modifications**

I'm in a plan mode where I can't modify files or run non-readonly tools, but I can still use read-only tools like reading files, listing directories, and searching through text. The user wants to merge a location into an icon table and split that table into three columns in a LaTeX resume template. I need to find the definition of the icon table, probably in files like base_resume.tex or generated resume.tex. I'll inspect a few relevant files to clarify the user's requirements while considering the "location" field.
**Forming a reading plan**

I need to use the read_file tool since I'm in read-only mode. After reading the files, I’ll create a detailed plan and ensure I'm using the correct Markdown formatting, specifically using ## or ### for headings instead of #. It seems efficient to utilize multi_tool_use.parallel to read multiple files at once, which should speed things up. Finally, I have to remember to call create_plan once I've gathered all the necessary information!</details></think>

I’ll first inspect your LaTeX resume/cover letter templates to find the current icon table and the separate location line, then I’ll propose a small, focused change: (1) integrate the location into that table, and (2) re-layout the table into three columns while keeping spacing clean. I won’t edit any files yet; I’ll just prepare a clear plan you can approve.

**Analyzing resume template adjustments**

I noticed the "icon table," tied to the `headersocialstyle` at specific lines, seems to involve icons arranged in rows. The user's feedback indicates that the location feels out of place and they want it integrated into the icon table. They prefer splitting the table into three columns instead of having a single tall column. Given there are 7 potential fields, we can work with `tabularx` or another table method to accommodate these new arrangements effectively.
**Planning column adjustments for the template**

To create 3 columns, I could fill them by designating three rows: the first for email, mobile, and location; the second for GitHub, LinkedIn, and homepage; and the third for homepage2, leaving some columns blank if needed. However, the conceptual aspect needs more clarity before any coding changes are made. The location currently appears with `\address{}`, which might be integrated into the icon table, so I need to ensure it’s not a standalone line to meet the user's request.
**Reviewing address usage in template**

In the `base_resume.tex`, I see that we're still using `\address`, which is part of how the awesome-cv class is designed. Typically, the header features the name prominently, followed by the position and then a line for address, mobile, and email. By customizing `headersocialstyle`, I can change how things appear after the icons. It seems like the address might be displayed separately, so I’ll need to check the awesome-cv.cls file to understand how `\makecvheader` incorporates both address and headersocialstyle.</details></think>

**Exploring robust formatting options**

I'm considering a more robust approach using `tabularx` with equal columns, but that requires the tabularx package. I suspect that awesome-cv might already utilize it, or I could add `\usepackage{tabularx}` myself. It seems like I need to check if that package is already included in the class document. I might also find some definitions related to 'tabularx' by using grep to search through the files. Sounds like I have a plan forming!</details></think>

**Evaluating column arrangement**

I think splitting into three columns is a viable option for the new arrangement. However, the exact details on how to assign fields to each column aren't that critical; I can probably choose a default. It seems like there's no need for questions on this. I'm curious if the user notices the icon table in the cover letter template, though. I might want to check similar code in base_cover_letter.tex.</details></think>

**Updating templates for consistency**

I'm thinking about how to update the cover letter and resume formats to maintain a consistent layout. The user mentioned an "icon table" and a "3 inches of paper," so I should integrate these specifications into both documents. I'll ensure that location details are added properly and adopt a three-column layout in both the base_resume.tex and base_cover_letter.tex files. It’s essential to check with the user to clarify if these changes should apply to all document types or just the resume and cover letter.
**Clarifying layout changes**

I'm realizing that changes to base_resume will also impact leadership_resume since it likely derives from the base. There's a generated file named leadership_resume.tex, but I don't think it needs a separate template. Given the goal of limiting questions, I should ask a single clarifying question: do they want the layout change to apply to the resume, the cover letter, or both? This will help inform my plan, even if it doesn't create a significant difference. Waiting for their response is acceptable before moving forward.
**Preparing to ask clarifying questions**

I know I need to present a plan using create_plan after the user answers my question. The system instructions say not to call create_plan until all questions are answered, so I should ask now and pause the planning process. Even though the user prefers minimal questions, they allow me to ask 1-2. A straightforward question is: should I apply the header layout changes to both the resume and cover letter, or just the resume? I'll keep it simple!
**Framing the question for the user**

I’m ready to send the user a multiple-choice question, but I need to follow the required format: a numbered list without bold text. My first question will be: 

1. Should the new 3-column icon layout be used for both the resume and cover letter headers, or just for the resume? (a) both, (b) resume only. 

I was considering a second optional question about including an address icon, but it seems trivial, so I'll skip that. For now, I'll just ask this single question and hold off on the create_plan until I get their response.</details></think>

1. Should the new 3‑column icon layout (with location merged in) be used for both the resume and the cover letter headers, or only for the resume?  
   - a) Both resume and cover letter  
   - b) Resume only
